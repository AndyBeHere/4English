## 2. Discussion: What's the best way to treat mental-health problem in your life?

> As there is question or discussion raised in the audio, I just pose one and talk about it. I'm not sure if I‘ve ever met a degree of mental-health problem, but I confirm most Chinese just look over it and very few choose to see a doctor when they find some wrong mentally. So I strong recommend you to consult mental-health professioner if you feel bad mentally.
