2. Discussion: Is such stunt like what Banksy did art or a lot of nonsense?

In my mind, what Banksy did is definitely a show of performance art. Although, I'm not quite sure what the definition of performance art is, the action Banksy took inspired public to think about the value of a piece of painting and sparked huge dispute about the auction. That's just the power of performance art I can feel.
