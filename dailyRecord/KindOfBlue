# Kind of blue: science of colour

Colours appear in languages at different times.
</br>

In ancient texts, from the Hindu Vedas to Icelandic myths, red appears first, followed by yellow, green and finally blue.
</br>

A new analysis published in the Journal of Cognition and Culture suggests that violet only became prevalent, in art rather than in texts, after its use in the 1860s by Impressionist painters in France.
</br>

Allen Tager, an independent scholar, visited 42 countries to examine by eye nearly 140,000 artworks.
</br>

He found violet in only 87 paintings before the mid-nineteenth century.
</br>

 Impressionists, by contrast, used the colour so often they were accused by critics of "violettomania".
 </br>
 
 Only in the early 20th century did violet become an established part of the artist's palette.
 </br>
 
 What this means is contested.
 </br>
 
 But if, as some scientists believe, language reflects a person's worldview, Mr Tager's finding suggests that for many, the world is now a bluer place than it was 150 years ago.

## 2. Discussion: Is such stunt like what Banksy did art or a lot of nonsense?

> In my mind, what Banksy did is definitely a show of performance art. Although, I'm not quite sure what the definition of performance art is, the action Banksy took inspired public to think about the value of a piece of painting and sparked huge dispute about the auction. That's just the power of performance art I can feel.
