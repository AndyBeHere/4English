## 2. Discussion: Which one you prefer? e-book or print-book?

> For me, I prefer reading a print-book when I'm travelling or trying to learning something new without a urgent deadline. It's more enjoyable to read a print-book. While, if I need to search for something in short time period, such as doing scientific research, I would rather read e-materials for getting useful information as quickly as possible. It's more efficient to read e-book.
