# Kind of blue: science of colour

① Colours appear in languages at different times.
</br>

② In ancient texts, from the Hindu Vedas to Icelandic myths, red appears first, followed by yellow, green and finally blue.
</br>

③ A new analysis published in the Journal of Cognition and Culture suggests that violet only became prevalent, in art rather than in texts, after its use in the 1860s by Impressionist painters in France.
</br>

④ Allen Tager, an independent scholar, visited 42 countries to examine by eye nearly 140,000 artworks.
</br>

⑤ He found violet in only 87 paintings before the mid-nineteenth century.
</br>

 ⑥ Impressionists, by contrast, used the colour so often they were accused by critics of "violettomania".
 </br>
 
 ⑦ Only in the early 20th century did violet become an established part of the artist's palette.
 </br>
 
 ⑧ What this means is contested.
 </br>
 
 ⑨ But if, as some scientists believe, language reflects a person's worldview, Mr Tager's finding suggests that for many, the world is now a bluer place than it was 150 years ago.

## 2. Discussion: Is such stunt like what Banksy did art or a lot of nonsense?

> In my mind, what Banksy did is definitely a show of performance art. Although, I'm not quite sure what the definition of performance art is, the action Banksy took inspired public to think about the value of a piece of painting and sparked huge dispute about the auction. That's just the power of performance art I can feel.

## 3. Article deconstruction

文章标题：差不多是蓝色（其实是指紫罗兰这种接近蓝色又不是蓝色的颜色），颜色背后的科学</br>

文章第一句，作者表达在语言的发展过程中，伴随着不同的色彩词也慢慢地进入语言系统。</br>

文章第二句，对第一句话进一步进行解释，通过具体的例子说明了不同颜色在不同时期进入语言系统。</br>

文章第三句，点出了文章的要点，即一个新闻期刊发表的一项研究。</br>

文章第四、五、六、七句，阐述了这项研究的细节（包括who/what he did/what he found）和这项研究的事实部分</br>

文章第八句，作者有事实性描述转入揭露这项研究的启示</br>

文章第九句，作者承接上一句，提出一种启示，即画作中颜色的变化反映了世界在我们眼中的变化</br>

总的来说，1-2句是背景，3-7句是这项研究事实性的细节，8-9句是探究事实的启示
