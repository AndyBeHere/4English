> My favorite novel written by Jin Yong is The Heaven Sword and Dragon Sabre. I love it not only because of the diverse and unputdownable stories and heartfelt romance between Mrs Long and Mr Yang but also the spirit it conveys to readers that with great power comes great responsibility.The Mr Yang's experience that tranferring from a philistine to a great swordman motivates me to keep going and contribute more to society as my ability improves.
